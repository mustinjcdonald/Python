    "Purpose: Create a program that will run a list of correct letter answers against a list of student answers to calculate a grade\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm:\n",
    "1. Open files that contians correct answers and read each line into an array.\n",
    "2. Open file that contains student answers and find the student name when the index is -1.\n",
    "3. Then load every index after that into a tuple that contains both names and grades.\n",
    "4. Then run the files against eachother and use a counter to hold how many matches are found.\n",
    "5. Record this number as the students score and divide it by the total number of answers in the correct file.\n",
    "6. Run an if statement that will decide if the student failed by missing more than 5 or else they pass.\n",
