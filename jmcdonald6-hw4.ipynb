    "Assignment: Homework 4\n",
    "Due Date: 10/23/18\n",
    "Purpose: Create a program that assigns an iterated year starting at 1903 to each line of Series Winners. \n",
    "         Then allow the user search by year for the winning team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm:\n",
    "1. Open file that contains the list of winners\n",
    "2. Write a for loop that will assign the iterated year to the incremented line in file\n",
    "3. Build array that will be used to count that amount of times a certain team is found to count wins\n",
    "4. ask user for input of year between 1903 - 2017\n",
    "5. Write if else statement that will let the user know that 1904 and 1994 were not played, and if they did not enter a valid year\n",
    "6. Keep asking for user input until they enter the string \"exit\"\n",
